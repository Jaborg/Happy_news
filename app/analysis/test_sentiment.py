He is facing criticism following defeat in the Hartlepool by-election and losing control of several councils. Sir Keir has already sacked his deputy Angela Rayner as Labour's chair and campaigns co-ordinator. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said she had been made a scapegoat. But Sir Keir has said he takes full responsibility for Labour's election results in England. Thursday's elections marked the first test of voter opinion since he became party leader last year.

There was bad news for Sir Keir on Saturday night when a swing to the Conservatives in County Durham saw Labour lose overall control of the council for the first time since 1925. This followed the loss of Hartlepool - held by Labour since the constituency was created in 1974 - to the Conservatives. It's no surprise that Sir Keir Starmer will be reshuffling his shadow cabinet. But after a largely negative reaction to news that Angela Rayner was to lose her campaigning role the task became urgent. Sources say she will now be offered a frontline shadow cabinet role. That may calm concerns of some on the left of the party that Ms Rayner was being marginalised - and that the party leadership was tacking right. Reshuffles can strengthen leaders but sometimes they do the opposite. Sir Keir will want to reward rising stars with good media profiles such as shadow schools minister Wes Streeting. But can he also bolster his team by bringing in big beasts such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn? And will those facing demotion go quietly and accept other roles in the name of unity? Westminster is awash with speculation that Jon Ashworth could be moved from his shadow health secretary role and that Anneliese Dodds could be moved from her role shadowing Chancellor Rishi Sunak. And there seems to be a view that shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy would be better suited to a domestic portfolio. Overall the aim is to have more identifiable faces on the front bench who can increase the party's impact. But reshuffles create losers as well as winners - and conducting one in the wake of worse-than-expected election results is a high-wire act. But there was some better news for Sir Keir when the party retained the mayoralties of London Liverpool and Greater Manchester - and took the West of England mayoralty from the Conservatives. These results were announced on Saturday the same day that Sir Keir removed Ms Rayner from her election duties on the same day.  A source said she would continue to play a senior role in the leader's team. But Sir Keir has come in for criticism from senior figures on Labour's left including Mr McDonnell who told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show Ms Rayner had been scapegoated. He said the leader's style of running the party was very centralised and that he had controlled the election campaign. Mr McDonnell also asked what PR genius had decided to remove Ms Rayner's campaigning role on Saturday when there had been some good news with the mayoral victories. He called it a huge mistake while former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott described it as baffling. And MP Jon Trickett whom Mr Starmer sacked from the shadow cabinet when he became leader last year tweeted: I don't think we should rule out a leadership challenge. But Dan Norris who won the previously Conservative-held West of England mayoralty for Labour said his leader had done a grand job a brilliant job helping with his campaign. He told BBC Breakfast: Keir made it possible for people to listen to Labour's message and then be influenced and that's why the result was so good because people listened to what we had to say... And obviously that's really great for me and great for the Labour Party. Sir Keir has also been criticised for picking a frontbench team lacking in well-known figures with suggestions that senior MPs such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Been could make a return in the reshuffle. He took over as leader last year following Labour's worst general election defeat since the 1930s and has said the party has a mountain to climb if it wants to get back into government.
